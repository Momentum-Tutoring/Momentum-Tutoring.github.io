### Why Buy a Bundle?

If your child only needs help on a specific unit in one of their classes, then 1 hour may suffice. However, if your child is looking for help across multiple topics and classes,  then creating a multi-session plan will ensure the most preparedness. If you are unsure which is best, select “N/A” and we will determine which option is most appropriate during the orientation. Payments will be through Paypal after each individual session.
