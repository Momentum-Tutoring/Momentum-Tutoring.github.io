    <p style="padding: 10px;">
        Hailing from the renowned Eleanor Roosevelt High School, our team members have achieved impressive
        1500+ SAT scores and have already been accepted to top universities (Duke, UVA, Purdue Engineering).
        Each and every one of our carefully vetted tutors have demonstrated deep passions for the STEM subjects. 
        Simultaneously, tutors maintain top ELA and history grades, making our team an elite, highly capable guild that
         will give your child the momentum they need to succeed.

    <p style="padding: 10px;">
        Momentum’s approach is focused on building intuition through shifts in perspective, rather than simply “rote” learning.
        As high school students, we can relate to fellow NYC students, allowing us to build a deeper connection that resembles a
        friend more than a teacher. The tutors themselves are a tight-knit family who learn and grow together every day. While your 
        child will only be interacting with one tutor at a time, multiple tutors from Momentum will help plan the tutoring strategy
        for your child. You or your child can request your tutor’s phone number for help outside of tutoring sessions
