title: Why I Chose Momentum
---

### Note from JJ Ishizaki, Co-Founder

My first tutoring job was when I was a junior, when I volunteered to tutor chemistry to an underclassman. Then, I further persued tutoring as I mentored a middle schooler in math. Both of these experiences were extremely rewarding and I strongly attribute that to the one-on-one nature of the tutoring I preformed. By meeting my pupils in quiet, private enviornments, I was able to connect with them in a friendly and conversational manner. As well, settings like these enabled me to personally tailer practices and explainations. As a result, I quickly learned the value of teaching concepts that were familiar to me in ways that younger audiences can understand. At the same time, I was even able to see the effectiveness of this style of tutoring as my chemistry student went on to achieve high 90s on his subsequent exams. 

Now, as I continue my acedemic journey, I only hope to facilitate more of these intimate yet powerful tutoring sessions. Thats exactly why I co-founded Momentum. By working to tutor more students, I aspire to learn more about teaching and working with the youth in STEM subjects. Simultaniously, Momentum gives me the privailage to collaborate with other tutors as they go out and share their own passions.
