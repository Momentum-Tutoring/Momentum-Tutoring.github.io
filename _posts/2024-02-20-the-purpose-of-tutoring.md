title: The Purpose of Tutoring
---

### Note from George Hall, Co-founder

As an assistant manager at Kumon for over a year, I’ve seen the horrors of traditional, group-tutoring institutions. When a one-size-fits-all approach is employed, no child’s needs are entirely met, and many kids make little progress after months of endless worksheets. Distractions are frequent, learning materials are often missing, and the focus of an instructor is split between multiple children at once. 

Reflecting on what I’ve observed at Kumon, I began questioning the fundamental purpose of tutoring. Is it merely a means to pass a test or gain admission to a prestigious school? While these are undoubtedly valid reasons for seeking additional instruction, I believe that effective tutoring should transcend being a mere tool to move a student from point A to point B.

Great tutoring utilizes “first-principles thinking,” instilling a confidence in students that exceeds mere memorization. Remembering how to answer a question is one skill, whereas knowing why an answer is fundamentally correct is a different beast altogether.  

This is exactly why we founded Momentum Tutoring; I have personally seen that children learn best when presented with friendly, one-on-one lessons that prioritize understanding over regurgitation. Our goal is to empower students academically and personally, promoting excitement around understanding. Join us on this journey towards meaningful and impactful learning!
