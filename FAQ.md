### Where do the tutors meet?

Ideally we would like to meet at the student's apartment, if that isn't possible, we would be happy to arrange a separate meeting location, like a library.

### Do you “guarantee” results? How will we know if it’s effective?

During the first session, we will administer a quiz (no more than 10 minutes) to evaluate the student's position

### What experience / qualifications do you have? How long have you been tutoring?
### Why should I use you?
### Will you have check-ins with me?
### How long is each session? How is each session structured?
### Can we try a session to see if there’s a fit? 
### What if we don’t like our tutor?
### What if my child needs accommodations?
### Are tutors available for questions outside of sessions?
### What is your refund policy?
