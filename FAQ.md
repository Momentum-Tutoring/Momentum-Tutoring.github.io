### Where do the tutors meet?

Ideally we would like to meet at the student's apartment, if that isn't possible, we would be happy to arrange a separate meeting location, like a library.

### Do you “guarantee” results? How will we know if it’s effective?

During the first session, we will administer a quiz (no more than 10 minutes) to evaluate the student's position. Afterwards, towards the end of the alotted hours, we will administer a separate but similar quiz to reevaluate the student's progress. 

### What experience / qualifications do you have? How long have you been tutoring?

All of our tutors have consistant high 90s in math, science, and English classes and have personally demonstrated intests in the STEM field. Their motivation, combined with stellar test scores, make our tutors confident in their ability to educate your child.

### Will you have check-ins with me?

Whether it's a physical talk, or a short text message, tutors will always have small check-ins with parents after every meeting with the child.

### How long is each session? How is each session structured?

The length of each session is completely up to you! After purchasing a package, you have the freedom to arrange the hours in the way that best meets your needs. For example, after purchasing 3 hours, you can arrange 3 hour-long sessions, or simply have 1 large 3 hour session.

### Can we try a session to see if there’s a fit? 

After purchasing a package, a tutor will reach out to you regarding a 20 minute orientation session on zoom. This 20 minute session will not count take away from the alotted package hours and will serve as an informal meeting for the tutor to get to know the child. If you or the child are discontent after this meeting, we will not hesitate to offer another tutor. 

### What if my child needs accommodations?

Accessibility is at the core of our mission here ta Momentum. If your child is in need of any accomodations, please tell us in our sign-up google form or during the 20 minute orientation. Afterwards, we can discuss and devise a specific plan.

### Are tutors available for questions outside of sessions?

Of course! Should the child have any questions outside or between sessions, they will have acess to our phone numbers and emails to contact us. Our tutors will be happy to assist and foster your child's curiosity.
