<hr>

### Where do the tutors meet?

Ideally, we will meet at the student’s apartment. If that isn’t possible, we would be happy to arrange a separate meeting location, such as a library.

### Do you “guarantee” results? How will we know if it’s effective?

During the first session, we will administer a quiz (no more than 10 minutes) to evaluate the student’s capabilities. Towards the end of the allotted tutoring hours, we will administer a separate but similar quiz to evaluate the student’s progress. 

### What experience / qualifications do you have? How long have you been tutoring?

All of Momentum’s tutors have extensive tutoring experience, whether that be independent, in-school or institutional (Kumon) tutoring. Additionally, we consistently achieve 95%+ in math, science, and humanities classes, alongside stellar test scores (1500+ SAT). These factors make our tutors confident in their ability to educate your child.

### Will you have check-ins with me?

Whether it’s an in-person discussion or short text message, tutors will have check-ins with parents after each meeting with their child.

### How long is each session? How is each session structured?

The time, date and length of each session is completely flexible! After purchasing a package, you have the freedom to arrange the hours in the way that best meets your needs. For example, after purchasing a 3 hour bundle, you can arrange three 1-hour sessions, two 1.5-hour sessions, one 3-hour session, etc.

### Can we try a session to see if there’s a fit? 

After signing up, your tutor will reach out to arrange a free, 20 minute Zoom orientation, allowing the tutor to get to know the child. If you or the child are discontent after this meeting, we will not hesitate to offer another tutor.

### What if my child needs accommodations?

Accessibility is at the core of our mission here at Momentum. If your child is in need of any accommodations, please tell us in the sign-up Google Form or during the 20 minute orientation. Afterwards, we can discuss and devise a specific plan.

### Are tutors available for questions outside of sessions?

Of course! Should the child have any questions outside or between sessions, they will have access to our phone number and email. Our tutors will be happy to assist and foster your child’s curiosity.
